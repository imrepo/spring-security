===============

This repository contains examples on how to implement different functionalities with the Spring Security framework. 
<br />

### Spring Security 4.x

Spring version: 4.3.14.RELEASE <br />
Spring Security version: 4.2.4.RELEASE <br />
Java version: 1.8

<br />

* **Basic in-memory**: The most basic example of a secured application. Users are defined in-memory in the security 
configuration. Secured paths are 'home' and 'admin' which are available depending on the user role.

    [v4-xml-basic-inmemory]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/xml/v4-xml-basic-inmemory

<br />

* **Basic JDBC**: Modified version of basic-inmemory where users are stored in an in-memory database (H2).

    [v4-basic-jdbc]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/javaconfig/v4-basic-jdbc

<br />

* **Basic JDBC with H2**: The previous basic-jdbc example configuring a H2 servlet to enable connecting to the in-memory database.

    [v4-basic-jdbc-h2]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/javaconfig/v4-jdbc-h2-console

<br />

* **BCrypt password encoder**: The previous basic-jdbc example configuring a password encoder that uses BCrypt hashing 
function in order to encode user credentials before persisting them.

    [v4-xml-bcrypt]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/xml/v4-xml-password-encoder-bcrypt

<br />

* **Remember-me token**: Configures a remember me using a token approach, which sets a cookie in the browser.

    [v4-rememberme-token]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/javaconfig/v4-rememberme-token

<br />

* **Remember-me persistent**: Configures a persistent remember me. THis is a more secure version which relies on a database

    Links to source code: [Spring Boot][v4-boot-rememberme-persistent] | [JavaConfig][v4-rememberme-persistent]

    [v4-boot-rememberme-persistent]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/boot/v4-boot-rememberme-persistent
    [v4-rememberme-persistent]: https://github.com/xpadro/spring-security/tree/master/v4/javaconfig/v4-rememberme-persistent

<br />

* **JDBC full sample**: Complete example covering the basic features of a secured application, described below:
    * user details backed up by an in-memory database (H2)
    * custom login page
    * encrypted credentials with BCrypt
    * CSRF protection
    * logout feature
    * remember-me feature

<br />

* **JDBC full sample with Thymeleaf**: The above example but using Thymeleaf instead of JSPs.
